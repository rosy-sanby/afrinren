TODO

- run traceroutes so that they have sufficient time to complete - fix one-off measurements
- streamline whole process (one main python file?) 
   so that only one command is needed to collect new set of info
- run different traceroutes
    - UDP
    - TCP
    - different paris
    - more packets?
- *if path does not reach destination, schedule for ping
     - schedule those ones for a ping
     - add the latency info into the json files
- figure out how to compare to see which have more paths,
   which have different paths, which combination is more accurate etc
    - choose protocol that reaches destination/has least lost packets
    - ...
- find overlapping paths and run from different hops
    - find hops with matching ip addresses going to a particular destination (ie: overlapping path)
    - check if latency is similar
    - start one traceroute from this hop instead
        - edit atlas_traceroute.py to include firsthop parameter
- put final info into json files for visualisation

IN PROGRESS

- *if path does not reach destination, schedule for ping
    - found which ones need pings




DONE

- aggregate all files in a folder
- take hop ip addresses, get coords and then make summarised json file with avg rtt and ip coords
- json->geojson (fri)?
